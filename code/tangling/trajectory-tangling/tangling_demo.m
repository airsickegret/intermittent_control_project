                       %% TANGLING DEMO
%
% Data formatting 
% Data should be formatted as for jPCA. Each data structure (e.g. D_m1,
% located in M1_sampleData.mat) contains C elements corresponding to the
% number of conditions (here, 2). The t x n matrix 'A' contains the
% trial-averaged firing rates as a function of time for each neuron. All
% other fields are optional. The 'times' field indicates the time course of
% each sample in A and the 'analyzeTimes' field indicates which of these
% times should be analyzed for tangling.

% 
% Sample data contents 
% The data included in this demo were recorded in the Churchland lab at
% Columbia University. Single-unit neural data were recorded sequentially
% from a macaque monkey during the performance of a hand-pedaling task.
% Monkeys grasped a hand crank and cycled through a virtual environment for
% a number of prescribed cycles as indicated by a visual cue. The data
% included here correspond to two seven-cycle conditions. EMG data were
% recorded with intramuscular electrodes and are rectified and filtered to
% obtain an envelop of the muscle response. Neural and EMG were filtered
% with a Gaussian kernel with a standard deviation of 25ms and trial
% averaged. For more information about data processing and the task, see
% Russo et al Neuron 2018.

%% Plot example behavioral kinamtics
% The sample data contain two conditions: seven-cycle for forward pedaling
% starting at the bottom and seven cycle for backward pedaling starting at
% the bottom. Plot the kinematic data (hand position and velocity, torque,
% and wrist angle) from 8 example sessions to get a feel for the behavior.
% Data have been trial averaged and aligned as described in Russo et al
% 2018. The analysis time window is 100ms before movement onset to 100ms
% after movement offset.

%% Visualize tangling in EMG
% Here is some code to aid visualization of tangling on the sample
% datasets. The first two dimensions of neural trajectory (X) are plotted
% verses one another. A time point with high tangling (t1) was chosen and
% is plotted as an arrow in blue. In black arrow is another time point
% (t2). The direction of the arrow indicates the direction of the
% derivative in two dimensions at that time point while the size of the
% arrow represents the magnitude of the derivative (e.g. the speed).
% Tangling between two pairs of points will be high if the locations of t1
% and t2 are similar but the derivatives are different in terms of
% maginutude or direction. Note that these plots are in two dimensions but
% tangling was caluclated on however many dimensions was specified above
% and that a constant was added to the denominator to prevent hyperbolic
% growth.
%
% Press (or hold) the down arrow to step through t2 and see how tangling
% changes as X and X_dot change with respect to one another. If
% withinConditionsOnly was set to false, you will see t2 from the same
% condition as well as t2 from the other condition (just keep steping
% through t2). The visualization will pause briefly when tangling becomes
% particularly high. Press CTR+C to exit early if you like, otherwise it
% will end when it has stepped through all t2s. Note that I wrote this code
% specifically for the demo so some things have been hard coded (e.g. what
% is considered "particularly high" tangling) and I can't guarentee it will
% look super pretty for all datasets. Hopefully, it is useful for gaining
% intuition for the metric and exactly what it measures. (read: apologies
% for the jankiness).
