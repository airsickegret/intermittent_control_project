# intermittent_control_project
A repository (serving as a type of online lab notebook) for Caleb Sponheim's dissertation and thesis. 

## Note about what's *not* here yet

I will include figures as I see them as relevant. The same goes with processed data. Since git doesn't enjoy large files or large project sizes, I'll try to avoid dumping obsene numbers of figures on here.
