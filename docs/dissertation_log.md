# Current Status of Dissertation Project

I am struggling to replicate Naama's results from her paper. However, my analysis pipeline does correctly replicate her results with her own data
	- to do here: really run Naama's data through the _CS versions of my scripts, since they're technically different. Be honest with yourself.

my qualifying exam is coming up on August 14th, and here is my current plan for the form of my dissertation proposal:

My two main goals are: 
- to demphasize the idea that there are instantaneous shifts in population activity that link directly to intermittent control theory
- search out additional ways to potentially identify state shift structure in activity without assuming a discrete process.


1. There are transitions between neural population states, over time, in movement areas of the brain, surrounding movement. 

2. There is evidence for neural transitions between states within movements, not just between preparation and movement.

3. I think that there are distinct transitions between accelerative and decelerative segments of movement

4. I want to use a specific method to identify these transition points, and use additional methods to analyse those transitions.



### Update from 7/1/19:

I'm having significant issues still replication results. I pulled in a previously gathered dataset from the same monkey, doing a center-out task. The results of this analysis left a lot to be desired, with similar states to other Breaux datasets.

Last week, I tried to sort another day of data, 190226. Unfortunately, there's something wrong with my CUDA install or something, and it can't sort the entire file; I need to troubleshoot that.

Right now, I'm trying to make sure that the code I run on Naama's paper data (which replicates, and works), is the same code that's running on my own data. They're different scripts, so it's _possible_ that something in the scripts are ruining results. That would actually be nice, but god who knows.
