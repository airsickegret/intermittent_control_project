# Current Status of Dissertation Project

I am struggling to replicate Naama's results from her paper. However, my analysis pipeline does correctly replicate her results with her own data
	- to do here: really run Naama's data through the _CS versions of my scripts, since they're technically different. Be honest with yourself.

my qualifying exam is coming up on August 14th, and here is my current plan for the form of my dissertation proposal:


1. There are transitions between neural population states, over time, in movement areas of the brain, surrounding movement. 

2. There is evidence for neural transitions between states within movements, not just between preparation and movement.

3. I think that there are distinct transitions between accelerative and decelerative segments of movement

4. I want to use a specific method to identify these transition points, and use additional methods to analyse those transitions.
