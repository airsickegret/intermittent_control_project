# Using Hidden Markov Models to predict hand kinematics in motor cortex

## Maximum-likelihood

Whenever we try to fit a model, we're trying to find a way to arrange and permute parameters such that one could concievably draw the observed data from a sampling of the model itself. put another way, given the parameters of a model, we want to maximize the probability of the observed data.
